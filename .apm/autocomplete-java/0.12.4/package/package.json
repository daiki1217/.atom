For example:\n\n    ./src:./classes:./lib/*\n\nYou can also alter autocomplete behavior with package settings.  \n\nNOTE:\n* The package requires that either JAVA_HOME environment variable is set or JDK tools (javap, jar) are found in path. Alternatively you can set JAVA_HOME in package settings.\n* The package requires compiled classes to function, but it does not compile classes from source. Use other tools for compiling.\n* If you compile classes manually, disable the 'refresh class on save' setting and run 'refresh project' manually after compilation (ctrl-alt-shift-R). Also try to avoid running refresh command and your build scripts at the same time.\n* **Scanning all classes in classpath is still unoptimized. It might take a few minutes until autocomplete fully kicks in after opening a project, so please be patient.**\n* **Class resolution for variables and method return values is still a quick hack and it will be improved in the future. If the package fails to resolve class automatically, you can still examine methods with a class name if you know the class yourself (e.g. ArrayList.con...).**\n\n## Tips\n\nAt first, compile all your classes using your favorite build tool, and start your app. While editing java source files, lint and compile classes automatically with [linter-javac](https://atom.io/packages/linter-javac), and the autocomplete-java package will refresh changed classes automatically on save. You can also reload changed classes automatically in JVM with [spring-loaded](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-loaded) or some other JVM agent. This way you can develop your app while the app is running.\n\nNOTE: Linter-javac performs currently ok only on small projects ([linter-javac#38](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac/issues/38), [linter-javac#44](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac/issues/44)). On a larger project you might want to use some other tool to compile your files on save instead of linter-javac, at least for now.\n\nNOTE: Error in one class may prevent compilation of multiple classes. Therefore once you fix an error, multiple classes might be recompiled at once. So sometimes you might have to run 'project refresh' manually after you fix an error (ctrl-alt-shift-R). See issue [#19](https://github.com/keskiju/autocomplete-java/issues/19).\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributions are welcome.
